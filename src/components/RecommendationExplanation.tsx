                This combined policy offers extensive hospital coverage, including pregnancy and birth services, which is crucial for your expanding family. The extras cover includes dental, optical, and physiotherapy, which are beneficial for both adults and children. However, the premium is relatively high at $650 per month, and there are waiting periods for certain services, particularly for pre-existing conditions and pregnancy-related claims.

However, there are potential out-of-pocket costs at non-agreement hospitals, and some services may have waiting periods.
